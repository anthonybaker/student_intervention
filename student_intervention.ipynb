Given this context, I'd approach this challenge as a classification challenge, since we would need to understand multiple features (input values) to flag if an intervention is needed or not, meaning that we need to map it to a discrete output. In this case, we don't have a continuous possible outcome, but rather a discrete set of output values, which would be something like \"needs intervention\" or \"doesn't need intervention\"."

I’ve explored scikit-learn documentation, Wikipedia and several blogs, along with the Udacity course content, resources and my own notes. Based on that research, I’ve chosen to move forward with the following three algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Boosting - AdaBoost\n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Boosting - AdaBoost:** The goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability / robustness over a single estimator. The core principle of AdaBoost is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data. The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction. Ensemble techniques can be used in combination with other algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost or Gradient Boosting. \n",
    "\n",
    "-**Real World Examples:** They are sometimes used in Loan Prediction applications, or predictions for Age or Income. Ensemble Learning techniques are often used in Fraud Detection, Malware Detection, Medicine (detection of diseases based on MRI datasets), Face Recognition and Speech Recognition among others. Ensemble methods have been very successful in setting record performance on challenging datasets and are among the top winners of Kaggle data science competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Strengths:** Computationally efficient. No difficult parameters to set. Versatile ­ a wide range of base learners can be used with AdaBoost. It’s not prone to overfitting and can help to minimize noise, bias and variance. Overall, it provides More accurate prediction results. Ensemble methods are good when we are not sure which features to use, since it uses a sample of different features / questions to find the best performing ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "-**Weaknesses:** Seems susceptible to uniform noise. Weak learners should not be too complex ­to avoid overfitting. There needs to be enough data so that the weak learning requirement is satisfied. Adaboost can be slow to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Selection Justification:** Seems that ensemble learning models promote diversity of models, and offer a generally more accurate output. They are often used in classification problems, especially when there might be no concrete understanding over which features might be better. Real world applications seem to be close to the current problem we are trying to solve. I’m also curious to try out their accuracy, against commonly used algorithms like Random Forest and Base Decision Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Support Vector Machines are an algorithm that helps us to find the best line that separates our data by maximising the margin. They are similar to instance based ML, in particular the nearest neighbour algorithm, but we do some work to find just the neighbours that matter. When we don’t have linearly separable data, we can look into the concept of similarity (how similar is a point to another) and use what’s called the Kernel Trick, which through some clever math, allows us to move points to different dimensions, without modifying the data, creating a way for us to separate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Real World Examples:** SVMs have been used across applications like handwriting recognition (recognizing handwritten characters used widely), generalized predictive control (control chaotic dynamics with useful parameters) and text and hypertext categorization (text and hypertext categorization for both inductive and transductive models)\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Strengths:** Effective in high dimensional spaces. Still effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient. Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Weaknesses:** Tendency to overfit. If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoiding over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial. SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation. Their compute and storage requirements increase rapidly with the number of training vectors. They might not be able to properly model feature correlations. \n",
    "\n",
    "-**Selection Justification:** SVMs perform well at classification problems with high dimension spaces. Since we don’t know which features are the important ones, and what are their inter-relationships, I’m curious to see how well the algorithm performs. Also, although we have a lot of features, the amount of data is more than the features, which should make it work well enough. Although I was thinking of going for Gaussian Naive Bayes, since SVMs might perform better given our data, I wanted to give them a try and compare their performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression:** Logistic regression, despite its name, is a linear model for classification rather than regression. Logistic regression is also known in the literature as logit regression, maximum-entropy classification (MaxEnt) or the log-linear classifier. In this model, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled using a logistic function. In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Real World Examples:** Logistic regression is used in various fields, including machine learning, most medical fields, and social sciences. For example, the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), which is widely used to predict mortality in injured patients, was originally developed by Boyd et al. using logistic regression. Logistic regression may be used to predict the risk of developing a given disease (e.g. diabetes; coronary heart disease), based on observed characteristics of the patient (age, sex, body mass index, results of various blood tests, etc.). Another example might be to predict whether a Nepalese voter will vote Nepali Congress or Communist Party of Nepal or Any Other Party, based on age, income, sex, race, state of residence, votes in previous elections, etc. It is also used in marketing applications such as prediction of a customer's propensity to purchase a product or halt a subscription, etc. Other examples are predicting if an email is spam or not spam, whether a tumor is malignant or benign, and whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Strengths:** powerful machine learning algorithm that utilizes a sigmoid function and works best on binary classification problems. It’s simple. It’s easy to understand, interpretable, and can give pretty good results.It is the go-to method for binary classification problems (problems with two class values).\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Weaknesses:** Logistic regression (despite its name) is not fit for regression tasks. Sensible to outliers and noisy data. It does assume a linear relationship between the input variables with the output. Like linear regression, the model can overfit if you have multiple highly-correlated inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "-**Selection Justification:** Logistic regression is most commonly used when the data in question has binary output, so when it belongs to one class or another, or is either a 0 or 1, which makes it a good fit for this particular case. It can deal with feature correlation, unlike Naive Bayes and SVMs. "

    "Both scores are lower than training and testing the untunned model with 300 samples, but the tuned F1 score is slightly better than the untunned model with 200 samples. I suspect that the tuned model is selecting the best parameters that prevent overfitting, while genrating the best possible model and combination of parameters.\n",

    "After doing this, I was curious to test the AdaBoost algorithm with tuning, and see how it performed. As it turns out, The tuned AdaBoost has lower training score, but slightly better F1 testing score, and it performs better than the tuned SVC (although it has a lower score than the SVC untunned model trained with 300 samples). Also the training and testing times of the tuned AdaBoost are just slightly higher than the tuned SVC, and way better than the untunned AdaBoost. This might point out that at the end, the tuned AdaBoost is preventing overfitting while performing better than SVC for this particular case."
